<h3>Word Count</h3>
<p>Have the function WordCount(str) take the str string parameter being passed and return the number of words the string contains (ie. "Never eat shredded wheat" would return 4). Words will be separated by single spaces.

<h3>Letter Capitalize</h3>
<p>Have the function LetterCapitalize(str) take the str parameter being passed and capitalize the first letter of each word. Words will be separated by only one space.

<h3>Coin Determiner</h3>
<p>Have the function CoinDeterminer(num) take the input, which will be an integer ranging from 1 to 250, and return an integer output that will specify the least number of coins, that when added, equal the input integer. Coins are based on a system as follows: there are coins representing the integers 1, 5, 7, 9, and 11. So for example: if num is 16, then the output should be 2 because you can achieve the number 16 with the coins 9 and 7. If num is 25, then the output should be 3 because you can achieve 25 with either 11, 9, and 5 coins or with 9, 9, and 7 coins.

<h3>Array Sort</h3>
<p>Have the function ArraySort(arr) take the arr and sort the array as random number of array as possible</p>

<h3>Prime Checker</h3>
<p>Have the function PrimeChecker(num) take num and return 1 if any arrangement of num comes out to be a prime number, otherwise return 0. For example: if num is 910, the output should be 1 because 910 can be arranged into 109 or 019, both of which are primes.

<h3>Letter CountI</h3>
<p>Using the JavaScript language, have the function LetterCountI(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the first word with the greatest number of repeated letters. For example: "Today, is the greatest day ever!" should return greatest because it has 2 e's (and 2 t's) and it comes before ever which also has 2 e's. If there are no words with repeating letters return -1. Words will be separated by spaces</p>
